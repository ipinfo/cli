## prips-1.0.0
* `prips` is a command for printing all the IPs that exist within a CIDR and/or
IP range; it is effectively a combination of `range2ip` and `cidr2ip` in one.
* The command exists as a standalone binary in addition to as a subcommand on the
main `ipinfo` command.
* `prips` accepts inputs the same way our other commands do, via stdin, args,
files, etc.
